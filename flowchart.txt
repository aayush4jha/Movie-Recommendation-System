class Profile{
    // in this class user can create his/her profile with an handle name and 
    // can store movies name (which will be done using file handling)
    // that he likes and can make a playlist to keep track of 
    // upcoming releases he/she is excited for (movie name and release year is stored)
    // and in liked  movie file film name, info like director,cast, release year and ratings will also be stored
    
    // constructor to make user profile (userid / username)

    function to see your liked movies (by name of actors/directors/genre)
    function to add movies name in your liked movies list
    function to make a watchlist(upcoming movies with name and relaease year)
    function for web shows

    // when a user create his/her profile all these options should be 
    // given to him/her like if it wants to add movies or add upcoming movies names in 
    // his watchlist then on choice he select releated functions is called and further task
    // is done

    so when a new profile is created then user is given options to add movies/shows which he already
     watched in liked movies file or upcoming movies in upcoming movies file
    and another option to go back to main menu where user can select another option
 
}

// except that additionally when multiple profiles are created then for fast lookup we can use hashing where 
userid can be a key 
and related value is object of that user profile 

class recommendation{
// so in this class i will give my recommendations 

    files for different genres(like action,comedy,romance,thriller,etc.)
    // so when user want to see recommendation based on genre, program will display all genre name and 
    whichever user selects related function is called for example when comedy is selected then function to 
    dispaly file of comedy movies is opened 

    files for hollywood, bollywood, south movies
    last 2 decades famous bollywood movies
    movies of different actors
    movies of different directors
    web shows
    upcoming shows and movies;
    tv shows
    so these are all options for user to see my recommendations when given these option whichever user selects
    related file is opened through a 
    function call in which like if hollywood movies option is selected then a function will be called 
    to display that file of movies
}

// so some functions are common in both class like display of movies/shows and in recommendation 
class it is being used for different genre, regional , actors,directors, etc so this can be made a virtual function in some 
other class and can be overriden in both class this way i can impement polymorphism

// also use these oop concept data abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance
// where needed so like this project can be a oop project in c++


now when progeam starts user is given options of (main menu) 1.create profile, 2.search profile(lookup for his profile)
and 3. see recommendations list or 4.exit
if 1 is selected then user profile is created and by taking userid and then user is given options
to add movies in liked movies list 
to add in his upcoming movies list
to add web or tv shows
to see his liked movies file
to see his upcoming releases files
or go back

if 2 is selected then if his profile exists then options are given
to add movies in liked movies list 
to add in his upcoming movies list
to add web or tv shows
to see his liked movies file
to see his upcoming releases files
or go back
or if id dont exist then main menu is dispalyed after a error message 

so when 3 is selected then all those options are give i mentioned in recommendation class 
and then according to users choice related task is performed

so when user create his profile and add data to his liked movies list or watched movies list 
then i dont want to store it in file instead i want that if for example user is adding data to liked movies 
then in profile class there will be vector of objects of liked movies class or of watchlist class
in these class there will be data members of movies info like name, release date, director, actor,
rating 
so like if user want to add/see his movies list then he searches his userid and then in his profile object
all contents of his profile object is accessed 
i dont want to store profiles in different files
